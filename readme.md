# Job Listings page
This is my solution for the "Job Listings with filtering" challenge of Frontend Mentor.

What I like about Frontend Mentor is that they give you some details about what they like to see and sometimes some images but that's about it.
You're not given a solution so it's all on you to try and recreate the project as accurately as possible.

In this project I had to figure out how to filter all the different categories. How to re-sort the filter menu whenever a filter button was removed/clicked on. This was also the first time for me working with the insertAdjacentHTML function in combination with a local JSON file. It was a fun challenge for sure!
